----------------------


I've had many collections of config files over the years that I wish I 
could have as reference material or as live-loadable (and cacheable) 
from (m)any boxen.

first file is just a "dpkg -l" of my default install of crunchbang 
statler and then anything i added after about a month through synaptic, 
apt-get, dpkg, etc.

sleech is probably short for leech, shit, and slurp.
