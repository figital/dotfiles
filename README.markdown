sleech  July 12, 2010  scott@figital.com
----------------------


I've had many collections of config files over the years that I wish I 
could have as reference material or as live-loadable (and cacheable) 
from (m)any boxen.

first file is just a "dpkg -l" of my default install of crunchbang 
statler and then anything i added after about a month through synaptic, 
apt-get, dpkg, etc.

sleech is probably short for leech, shit, and slurp.

The only usable config file in here so far is .irssi/ ... after my last fresh Linux install I just git cloned sleech and then symlinked ~/.irssi to that directory in my local sleech repo. It's certainly quicker and easier than recustomizing an application.

I've noticed other folks have named similar repe's "dotfiles" .... maybe I'll rename to that soon.

Here's a good description of this line of thought ... http://blog.nelhage.com/2010/02/versioning-dotfiles-in-git/

8/22/11: renamed to dotfiles like everyone else
